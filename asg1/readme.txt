	First Animation in SDL
=================================================


Included files: Manager.cpp GenerateFrames.cpp free.c Sprite.cpp main.cpp
and associated header (.h) files (where the classes reside).

Project Description:

Implemented a simple animation in SDL, with a basic class structure. Project responsibility is removed out of main() and delegated between the two included class files. 

An example of running the program from command line:

make
./run

Known Bugs:
N/A - None. (However, it is worth mentioning that the SDL library functions create memory leaks)
